# Backend Developer

Manager of one and team player

## Process

- Git flow that we arrange based on the team needs
- Systematic code review
- A lot of git alias

## DevOps

`Kubernetes` and `Google Cloud` as I have been working on those since 2016
A lot of bash scripts

## Backend

I have worked 7 years on Symfony but I'm now more of a NodeJs guy
I love `microservices` architecture and @AIP.trade, we implemented this approach using `gRPC` and `graphQL`, you can find the relative medium article [here](https://medium.com/@svengau_17540/when-graphql-meets-grpc-3e9729d32e05)

## Coding style

- 2 spaces indent
- I usually name my commits in a way that `If applied, this commit will â€¦` in order to always have the same kind of sentence
- I early exit
- slowly migrating to `typescript`
- shared `eslint` on all micorservices
