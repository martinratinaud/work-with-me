# Frontend Developer

Manager of one and team player

## Process

Git flow that we arrange based on the team needs
Systematic code review
A lot of git alias

## Frontend 

I have played with jQuery during 7 years but this is now far away

I use now mostly React and styled-components with a shared library of components easily accesible thanks to storybook and netlify

## Coding style

- 2 spaces indent
- I usually name my commits in a way that `If applied, this commit will â€¦` in order to always have the same kind of sentence
- I early exit
- shared eslint on all micorservices
