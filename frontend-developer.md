# Frontend Developer

Manager of one and team player

## Process

- Git flow that we arrange based on the team needs
- Systematic code review
- A lot of git alias

## Frontend

I have played with jQuery during 7 years but this is now far away.

I use now mostly React and styled-components with a shared library of components easily accesible thanks to storybook and netlify.

My IDE is atom

I love

- React
- Typescript

## Coding style

- 2 spaces indent -> but will switch to tabs -> [see why](https://dev.to/alexandersandberg/why-we-should-default-to-tabs-instead-of-spaces-for-an-accessible-first-environment-101f)
- I usually name my commits in a way that `If applied, this commit will â€¦` in order to always have the same kind of sentence
- and I use this convention: [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/)
- I early exit
- shared eslint/tslint on all microservices

## Next

I think I will try to use Gatsby for my later projects as I find this technology incredibly smart.
