Happy, funny, full-of-ideas human who creates web platforms from 🇲🇺 Mauritius and **enjoy life** every day.

_and who sometimes create cheesy self describing methodology you should love! :-)_

## Family

Father of 2 girls

Husband of 1 wife

I apply kanban to my family life (weird but worth it :-))

## Personality

Love to experiment and I try to never read something great on the internet without trying it out soon after.

I’m a **doer**, **autonomous** but feel I’m a lot better when paired up with somebody I can exchange my ideas with.

I can talk to anyone about anything without being emotional (and that has not always been the case :-).

I automate everything I can.

I have a lot of ideas about building stuff, making the world better and I try to implement some of them.

I’m **happy** and to stay this way, the first thing we do in the morning with all my family is smile.

I love quotes and my favorite of all is by Coluche (a french humorist) and it sums up my mood today

> When you think it would only take for people to stop buying crap for people to stop selling it!

## Work environment

Work from 8am till 4pm, usually short break at noon.

Mauritius timezone GMT +4 (London +3, New York +8, San Francisco +11).

Sometimes music, sometimes Noizio.

Not often in coffee shops.

Sometimes with friends that work remotely too.

Sometimes from where my kids have activities to share this with them.

I use `Gmail` for emails as it allows very simply to use GTD methodology

I use there https://there.pm to locate my coworkers and know when I can ping them.
