# Work with me

## One sentence to describe myself

Happy, funny, full of ideas human who create web platforms and enjoy life

## Values

- Transparency
- Curiosity
- Happiness

## Family

Father of 2 girls

Husband of 1 wife

I apply kanban for my family life (weird but worth it)

## Personality

I love to experiment and I try to never read something great on the internet without trying it out soon after.

I’m a **doer**, **autonomous** but feel I’m a lot better when paired up with somebody I can exchange my ideas on

I can talk about anything to anybody without becoming emotional (and that has not always been the case :-)

I automate everything I can

I have a lot of ideas about building stuff, making the world better and I try to implement some of them

I’m **happy** and to keep being that way, first thing we do in the morning with all my family is smile

I love quotes and my favorite of all is by Coluche (a french humorist) and it sums up my mood noawadays

> When you think it would only take for people to stop buying crap for people to stop selling it!

## Work environment

Work from 8am till 16am, usually short break at noon

Mauritius timezone GMT +4

Sometimes music, sometimes Noizio

Not often in coffees

Sometimes with friends that work remotely too

Sometimes from where my kids have activities to share this with them

I use `Inbox` for emails as it allows very simply to use GTD methodology  

I use there https://there.pm to locate my coworkers
