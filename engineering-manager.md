# Engineering Manager / Team Leader

## Leadership Philosophy

I believe every employee should be happy and should come with h.is.er true self at work or anywhere else in the world.
Being open minded and transparent as you can be makes relationship more authentic and therefore comprehension more complete.
I think responsabilities and roles are better than titles and hierarchy and thus I like to empower people while still protecting my teammates.

## Answers to first 1:1 questions

- What makes you grumpy?

People in the team who do not want to share the fact they're not managing to do something and tell me that everything is fine.

- How will I know when you’re grumpy?

I'm kind of a direct person and never let a situation get worse than what it is, so I think I'll let you know.

- How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

Send me a funny GIF or tell me a joke (bad or good do not matter :-)

- How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

I prefer voice feedback if possible when I make a mistake or unplease you in any way as it is less subject to misunderstanding :-)
For positive feedback, I love it anyway you like!
In both case, I love to have a centralized feedback system for everybody as described in Holacracy.

- When do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

As-it-happens, always, or you can forget!

- How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

Public

- What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

Knowing each other better and understanding what really motivates you and what you dislike most. Sometimes knowing this makes it a lot easier to choose who's the best fit for the next feature.

- What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

In the next 3 months I want to give my best for the company I'm in and the people I work with because it's worth it
In the next year, I want to either convert the company I'm into a scale-up or join one of the best like Buffer, Doist or Alley as I feel the experience I have can be of great value for bigger teams too.

- What do you need from your manager?

I need autonomy and trust and also regular discussions on the long term vision.
If I can take part in the defining of this vision, I'll be the happiest!

- What do you need from your team?

A need for autonomy, efficient communication and a non-rejection for processes.
I love when the team I work in really owns the processes they create themselves, resulting in an incredible productivity and smoothness.
And I like when it's casual, fun and respectful.

- What do you need from your peers? (outside the team)

Exchange. I love to talk and discover other techniques or attempts to solve typical problems.
I'm definitely thinking that discussing problems is already a solution by itself

- What’s your favourite baked good?

Paris-Brest! (Yes I'm french ;-)

## What I expect from people who report to me

I expect a lot of casualty, as I would describe myself as a simple, smily human being.
You can talk straight to me with no fear, as I'm always open for discussion. Arguing and discussing everything has been a family thing and I've done it my whole life with people of VERY different point of views, so you can test me :-)!
I like to have concised documents about major technology decisions for track record and transparency with other teams so you can expect to help me write those!
I want you to tell me when things are good or bad and even if you plan on leaving the team. That things happened and questioning yourself about the future is always a great step forward, so let me help you in this.
You can also always share your vision of the product we're building so that I can describe it during our board meetings.
Passion also, because if you develop a passion for learning, you will never cease to grow


## What You can expect from me as your manager

Have ice breaking questions and 1:1 as soon as we share the same team, because I want us to know each other.
Honesty and a real two ways relationship.
Full transparency on the decision process and an explanation on each priority change.
Public recognition everytime it can happen and full transparency over my own goals.
With 14 years being a software developer and architect in PHP and Js, you can ask me about your technical challenges, I'd be glad to help. And like you also, I know how context switching can kill the productivity so I try to make it rare.
I also code review, a lot, so that we all own the code written by other teammates.
You can also expect a 1:1 in a pub if you live or come to Mauritius :-)
